OTools stands for Online Tools, which is a Python/Cython framework for developing multithread online systems in a simple way.

This framework is the evolution of [Akuanduba](https://github.com/gabriel-milan/Akuanduba), a very similar framework I've developed.
Although Akuanduba seemed OK to me, I realized it wasn't really user-friendly. OTools was developed to get as simple as possible
and yet powerful.

## Installation



## TODO

* Implement CLI (?)
